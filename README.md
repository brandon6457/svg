  ## Installation
    To use this application correctly, you will need to install Node.js, NPM, and inquirer (version 8.2.4) to create a the SVG images.
  ## Usage
    SVG images are created so the images dont lose their original dimensions when they are scaled to a different size. The edges are much more precise and professional rather than conventional images used as logos. For your next logo design, I highly recommend creating SVG images.
